## Calibration Notebook And Data

An annotated Jupyter notebook used to produce the A-matrix is provided in this
folder. It includes plotting, fitting, and error analysis.

The example data from one of the test calibrations we have performed is stored
in `data.zip`. The notebook runs against the data inside.
